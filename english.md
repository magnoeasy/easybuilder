## It's time to get hands-on 🖐️

Now we will learn how to make a basic project, menu and form, so you can already experience the features of Easy Builder.
    
After logging into Builder you will be faced with the following content:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114769820-107d1500-9d41-11eb-9ae1-29954922a707.png">
In the "Main" tab and right under "Project title" type in the title of your project (can be "ProjectTest") 
    
![ProjectTest13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087176-30cc1d80-c0bc-11eb-99a3-9f1dba3ae763.gif)
   

and click on the _Save & Close_ button

![Save$closeg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087205-5b1ddb00-c0bc-11eb-93fd-7c4d2d961a28.gif)


(It will take a while here as the database for your project is being created)

Now you will be on your home page with the three main tabs, in this case automatically it will be the "Project" tab. 

Then, you will be back at the home screen with the two main tabs "Form" and "Report" (which means "Form" and "Report" respectively), now click on the "Form" tab:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116601837-502b2b80-a901-11eb-8e29-009d8ff21b96.png)
And now click the _New_ button, it will automatically open a new tab in your browser.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114773410-694eac80-9d45-11eb-9582-bb667046a328.png">
    
On that new page, in the "Form Title" field write the title of your form (can be "FormTest").
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087290-f57e1e80-c0bc-11eb-96d1-919007483897.png)
    
Click the _"Save"_ button that is at the foot of the page.
    
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114774084-31943480-9d46-11eb-992d-d3c930421db8.png">

Select the "Textfield" component (from the side tab Tools - Gallery Fields) and drag it to the gray field where it says "Drop new field here!"

Now click on the component you dragged ("Textfield"), and soon a side tab will open on the right called "Properties of Field".⤵️
    
![Animação](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087612-c5844a80-c0bf-11eb-98df-d4e9f601fc26.gif)
    


There at the top of the "Properties of Field", under "General", In the "Name" field write ''Name'' and in the "Label" field also write "Name".
Now click the _"Save"_ button and then click the _"Run"_ button, it will open the following page:
    
![textemaild2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121060294-d7897b80-c798-11eb-8639-350840b5b68f.gif)

    
Here the preview of the saved records will be available. ⤴️

> Click on the _"New"_ button, you will be directed to the following screen:

![formtestnew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121061502-4a472680-c79a-11eb-9e3c-0eb0807ac8ad.gif)

Add the name "Lopes", and click the _"Save & Close"_ button !!!
    
![formtestnewnamelopes2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121063430-aad76300-c79c-11eb-9304-515445ae9ca9.gif)

    
<h3>⚠️Be careful not to confuse _"Save"_ instead of _"Save & Close"</h3>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114779385-702ced80-9d4c-11eb-8838-8133ec0a3aea.png">

Repeat the process by putting different name.

You can download the list of records in excel list format by clicking on the _"Export Excel"_ button and then the link to download the excel list will be sent to your email.
    
A short gif to help you:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114777405-09a6d000-9d4a-11eb-8a04-d538d5b34a76.gif">
    
### How to Run the Application 💻
    
When you get to the form screen, fill in the "Form Title"(the title of the form) and insert the "Textfield" and "Email" components:

(Under the "Control" column)

## WARNINGS⚠️

In most components, the "Properties of Field" sections (General, Values, Behavior, Presentation, Intro, Others) will not be shown to avoid repetition of content. 

So, to learn how to use these sections mentioned above, go to the tutorial of the "Textfield" component, because it will explain each section in detail.

However, you will have components showing the sections, because they will have different items and sections than the "Textfield" component.

To learn how to use the "Events" section, go to the tutorials for the "Decimal" and "Button" components.

Always check if there is continuation of content on the next page, sometimes the image does not fit on the same page.

To perform the "Static Image", "Upload Image", and "File Upload" tutorials, you must have storage (Blob Container).

If you have any questions, please contact Easy Comtec support.

<div id='id-component'/>

# COMPONENTS 🧱
There are 30 components that we will learn how to use, they are:
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Textfield</td>
  <td>TextArea</td>
  <td>Editor</td>
  <td>Hidden</td>
  <td>Integer</td>
  <td>Decimal</td>
  <td>Date</th>
  <td>DateTime</td>
  <td>Time</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>

</table>

It is important to realize that in the "Properties of Field" section, there are several sections ("General", "Behavior", "Presentation", "Events", "Intro", etc) can have more or fewer sections, and with more or fewer items, depending on the component.

The "Properties of Field" example in the image below is from the "Textfield" component.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115268685-e5b00980-a110-11eb-9b9e-1215c566626a.png">

It is important to know this so that it makes the process of locating the sections, items, etc.

Another recurring situation is referencing within the tutorial from one component to another tutorial within this document.

It is also important that you have already performed the steps in the tutorials "How to Create Your First Project, Menu and Form" and "How to Run the Application".

## Textfield 📓

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116603558-6e922680-a903-11eb-8b7f-65c1a9b26f2f.png)

The "Textfield" component is for writing text, mainly names, but it can also be used to record phone numbers using the mask on the field properties, we will see how to do that soon.

Select the "Textfield" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab called "Properties of Field" will appear on the right side of the screen

(If it doesn't appear, just click on the component you just dropped).

### Textfield 📓 > GENERAL 🎖️

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115269185-6f5fd700-a111-11eb-992d-2e9493159141.png">

In this "Properties of Field" tab, under "General", you have the "Name" field, this refers to the field identification for the coding, for possible programming later. Generally you will repeat what is written in "Label", which is the field identification for the user.

The "Column Title" field is used to identify the field when viewing the list (to view in list format, look at the top of the page, select "List").

The "Placeholder" field serves as a guide for what to fill in, it is interesting that you visualize this, write in the "Testing" field, observe the effect on the field in the form.

![000testing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122480578-7b4a0700-cfa3-11eb-80d1-e8a5aaba10d3.png)

### Textfield 📓 > VALUES 1️⃣

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115285074-d5555a00-a123-11eb-80ae-0092b27958a4.png">


In "Properties of Field", under "Values", there are 4 fields and a checkbox, which are respectively "Mask", "Default", "Minimum Length", "Maximum Length" and "Enable Barcode Scanner".

Under "Mask" you can determine the specific fill pattern, i.e. specific number and type of characters. For example, 
if you want the field to accept phone numbers in a specific format, you can fill this field with (99)99999-9999, do this now for testing.

To make it harmonious, go to "Name" and "Label" and write "Phone Number". Leave the "Placeholder" field blank.

Run the application.

![formtestnumber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121075901-1ffe6480-c7ac-11eb-9c4c-efed9654570d.gif)


Fill in the "Phone number" field with any number, it can be (99)99999-9999
and then click the button ![Save Close](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123150638-fc3c4f00-d438-11eb-9895-674a5dc67a82.png)


You are now able to view your records:
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121239691-f1e25880-c86f-11eb-8288-028d7c89dd6a.png)

 and the process is the same as before for adding new records.

"Default" refers to an automatic value fill. Enter in the "Default" field of "Phone Number" with "(45)99887-6655".

Run the application.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115288674-1b142180-a128-11eb-82f0-3a930b0e05aa.png">

Note that it is already filled in with (45)99887-6655, but you can change it.

"Minimum Length" refers to the minimum number of characters to be used when filling the field. For example, select and drag one more "Textfield" component into the form and then edit just this "Minimum Length" setting to a value of 5.

Run the application. When you fill the field you will notice that you need at least 5 characters to be able to save the record

"Maximum Length" refers to the maximum number of characters allowed when filling the field. For example, you can select and drag one more "Textfield" into the form and then edit just this "Maximum Length" setting to a value of 10.

Run the application. When you fill in the field you will notice that a maximum of 10 characters will be allowed in order to be able to save the record.

"Enable Barcode Scanner" refers to enabling barcode scanning. You can test this setting by selecting the check box and then run the application. On the registration screen, 
click on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115289090-9a095a00-a128-11eb-82ee-a03ac0411da2.png">and then it will trigger the device's camera, and scan the barcode.

### Textfield 📓 > BEHAVIOR 🎬

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115289428-ed7ba800-a128-11eb-89a1-a0fd60d1efef.png">

Here you will find 3 checkboxes (Required, Disabled and Visible) and 3 drop-down lists (Visibility Rules, Required Rules and Disabled Rules).

Translation: 

Required = Required
Disabled = Disabled
Visible

Visibility Rules 
Required Rules = Required Rules 
Disabled Rules

By default, the checkboxes "Required" and "Visible" will be checked, and the "Disabled" box will be unchecked.

You can change from required to optional, visible to invisible, and disabled to enabled by checking or unchecking the checkbox.

Regarding the rules for visibility, mandatory and disabled, it is important to note that they are dependent on another field within the form.

Let's test this in practice. Select and drag the "Integer" component into the form.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121243233-de38f100-c873-11eb-8f6c-abe83fe16841.gif)

Here in the "Others" section you will find this "Feed Data" list, which is used to fill the field with dummy data to validate it.

With the field "Phone Number" or "Full Name" you can fill it with the option "Phone" or "People" respectively.

Now run the application.

Automatically a new page will open in your browser, and you will see registration of dummy phone numbers/names on the screen (next page), which will check the field as valid.

To learn more about how to use this feature, go to the "Events" section of the "Decimal" and "Button" components.

### Textfield 📓 > INTRO ℹ️ 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294185-a7c1de00-a12e-11eb-9481-9df98b38dfef.png)

The "Intro" section serves as an instructive introduction, to explain about filling out the fields or whatever you think is important.

It is important to know that this functionality will only work the first time, if you want to test it again you will need to create a new form.

Let's test this now, select and drop two "Textfield" components into the form. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294159-9d9fdf80-a12e-11eb-8c99-378be69a4962.png)

In the first "Textfield", under "Position" select "Top", under "Order" type "1", under "Message" write "This is the first" (image on the next page).

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121413506-202d6a00-c93c-11eb-94b7-dd5ff872cc6c.png)

In the second "Textfield", in "Position" select "Right", in "Order" type "2", in "Message" write "This is the second one" .

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121413692-54a12600-c93c-11eb-8624-ae422147da0c.png)

Now run the application, and the following page will open:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121414734-5e775900-c93d-11eb-9796-59e6901722a0.png)

click on button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294470-05562a80-a12f-11eb-9dd2-e6adb2664492.png).

Then the intro effect will appear on the following page:
![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121414658-430c4e00-c93d-11eb-8a95-04c267751222.png)

This visualization of the highlighted field with the message beside (or below, etc.), is the effect of the settings in the "Intro" section.

You can keep adding new fields and switching the order and messages, but remember that it only works the first time, so to test it again you need to create a new form.

Here you will add the values, for example, create lists with the options to select, remembering that only one option can be selected with this component.

Now click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115922523-634a8100-a453-11eb-95a4-2eb6c60f6164.png)
will automatically open the modal window "Enumerations" (image on the next page), in "Name" write "Gender", in "Type" keep the option "String".

Now click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115923580-d30d3b80-a454-11eb-8fd6-3a7feb9d307d.png)

 . (Image on the next page)

Two important things to know about the "Enumerations" window:
Under "Type" you have two options you can select: "String" or "Integer". "String" refers to words, "Integer" refers to numbers.
"Max Length" refers to the maximum amount of characters each option will have.

Still on the "Values" section, there is the "Default" item, clicking on it will show the "Male" and "Female" options, this means that if you select one of these two now, when filling out the form one of them will already be selected, but you can still change it if you want. 

Run the application.

The component will look like this on the registration screen:

The "DropdownDB" component is for you to provide a list of options in menu format from a DataSource. The end user can insert data into this list.

 (Note: The only difference between "AutoComplete" and "DropdownDB" is that "AutoComplete" appears when it is searched and "DropdownDB" appears in a list)

Select the "DropdownDB" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here!". When you drop it, a tab will appear on the right side of the screen called "Properties of Field" (If not, just click on the field you just dropped).

To learn how to use this component, scroll down to the "Source" section of this tutorial.

In this "Source" section we will bring in the set of values entered into another field, which can be from another or the same form, as long as it is under the same project.

So let's start by creating one more form (as shown in the tutorial "How to Create Your First Project, Menu and Form").

And on this new form we will add the "Textfield" component into it.

![form color text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121950606-3b2f1e00-cd30-11eb-8ad6-a123d6cd272f.png)


In the "General" section,Name the "Name" and "Label" fields "Color".

Repeat the process to add the colors "Green", "Yellow" and "Blue".

Now let's go back to the other form with the "DropdownDB" component.

 You can do the same process with both fields in the same form.
Still in the "Source" section, under "Additional Data" you can add another set of values from a field as long as it is from the same form selected in "Class".

The "AutoComplete" component serves to provide auto-complete item insertion from a DataSource. The end user is able to insert data into this list.

The only difference between "AutoComplete" and "DropdownDB" is that "AutoComplete" appears when it is searched and "DropdownDB" appears in a list.

That is, if you know how to use "DropdownDB" you will also know how to use the "AutoComplete" component

Select the "Dropdown" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab will appear on the right side of the screen called "Properties of Field" (If it doesn't appear, just click on the field you just dropped).

In the "Source" section, under "Class" of the "Autocomplete" select the "Color" option, and under "Description Field" also select "Color". 

(The form "Color" and the field "Color" with the entries "Red", "Green", "Blue" and "Yellow" were created during the tutorial of the component "DropdownDB").

Now run the application.

On the registration screen, you will notice that when you type the initial letters, the available options will appear:

To learn more about how to use this functionality, go to the "General" section of the "Textfield" component.

## Signature ✒️
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140680-0c8cb380-a6ae-11eb-9d6b-4cbce5e464a6.png)

With this component you can add a user signature to your form.

Select the "Signature" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab will appear on the right side of the screen called "Properties of Field" (If it doesn't appear, just click on the field you just dropped).

To fully visualize the process of using the "Signature" component it will be necessary to follow the steps of the tutorials "How to Add a User" and "How to Give Permission to a User".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140718-1b736600-a6ae-11eb-897c-7476531eaf87.png)


To make the "Signature" component work you will need one more "DateTime" or "Date" component and two "Hidden" components.

So first we will add the "DateTime" component and name it "Date and Time", and we will name the "Signature" component "Signature".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140745-23330a80-a6ae-11eb-96ae-78a7e38011a2.png)


Select the checkbox "Current DateTime" from the "Values" section of the "DateTime" component to always be getting the current date and time.

Now select and drop the 2 "Hidden" components on top of the "Signature" and the "DateTime" components
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140789-2fb76300-a6ae-11eb-998a-0b9da9737820.png)

Select the first "Hidden" that is above the "Signature" and name it "Signature Hidden". 
And in the "Data Type" section, under "Type" select the "String" option. (image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140861-4fe72200-a6ae-11eb-85b4-ba85a0922eeb.png)

And in the "Hidden" that is above the "DateTime" name it "DateTime's Hidden". 
And in the "Data Type" section, under "Type" select the "DateTime" option. (image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140915-642b1f00-a6ae-11eb-8baf-4c522e0ddbc1.png)

Now go to the "Signature" section of the "Signature" component. In the "Date field" select the "Date and Time" option and in the "Info field" select the "Hidden Signature" option.

To make use of the "MultiTag" component we will have to create 3 forms. The first to add the names, the second to connect the names to a "DropdownDB" component, and then connect the second to the third form that will be the "MultiTag" form.

First step, create a new form with the "Textfield" component, also naming it "Team Member".
![TeamMember](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122629734-9432e500-d095-11eb-941e-bed31ce41b26.png)

Second step, create one more form using the "DropdownDB" component and name it "team meeting".
![TeamMeeting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122629793-04da0180-d096-11eb-9273-2578bb40404f.png)

In the "Source" section of this component, under "Class" select the "Team Member" option and under "Description Field" also select "Team Member". 

![TeamMeetingSource](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122629850-597d7c80-d096-11eb-8928-cc284b1595b9.png)

Now let's create the third form, naming it "Participants".  Add the "Multitag" component into the form.

![ParticipantsMultitag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123865571-7457b880-d902-11eb-816a-8dd86fb83b1e.png)

Now in the "Source" section of the MultiTag, under "Class" select "teammeeting", and under "DescriptionField" select "teammeetingId1" - (image below).

![TeamMeetingSource](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123865637-8b96a600-d902-11eb-94e9-c527340f4d57.png)

This component allows you to present extra data through a DataSource.

Select the "AdditionalData" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here!". When you drop it, a tab will appear on the right side of the screen called "Properties of Field" (If it doesn't appear, just click on the field you just dropped).

To see how this component is used, scroll down to the "Additional Data" section of this tutorial

To learn more about how to use this functionality, go to the "General" section of the "Textfield" component.

By selecting the checkbox ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116295860-ed565a80-a76f-11eb-84d2-b3f4a8b40d18.png), you will create the border for the component, and you can also edit the "Label" field.

Under "DataSource" you will select the DataSource created earlier. Beside, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116296065-27276100-a770-11eb-87e6-82d451cce125.png) is for updating the list, and the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116296149-3f977b80-a770-11eb-8771-9dfb8c91937a.png) is for adding a DataSource. 

To learn more about creating a DataSource, scroll down to the "DataSource" tutorial.

It is important to know that the DataSource is the name given to the connection to a database from the server. That is, you need to create this database, which can be the records created inside another form.

Therefore, it is also important that you have created the other form within the same project, and that you have the field added to "pull" from the database. 

DataSource Filter: will perform a filter inside the selected DataSource, i.e., if the DataSource has 10 fields, you can select if you want all of them or just one of them. 

Source Field: will pull the information from the source field.

Show: The options are: "First", "Last", and "Max" which means "First", "Last", and "Max" respectively.
 
Sorted by: Will sort the DataSource by the chosen option.

We will test this by creating two forms. On the first one we will name it "Source", on this one we will use two components: "Textfield" and "Dropdown".

Drag the "Textfield" component into the form and name it "Name", do the same with the "Dropdown" component and name it "Status". 

![Origin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122852967-d8b5bf00-d2e7-11eb-8f77-dc2333c0c2e6.png)

(To learn more about the "Dropdown" component, go to its tutorial)

In the "Status" field, under "Values" click the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116296368-884f3480-a770-11eb-8470-f88450cd50ff.png) button and add two values "Pending" and "Approved".

## Horizontal Line 📏🪓
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301516-7f616180-a776-11eb-8a5e-2ba596712fd3.png)

"Horizontal Line" does line breaks, with the main purpose of organizing the arrangement of components.

Select the "Horizontal Line" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301545-89836000-a776-11eb-939f-27e7d0fbb75a.png)

When you place the "Horizontal Line" inside the form, you will notice that it is just a line, with the only function of organizing the disposition of the components inside the screen.

Let's add two "Textfield" components inside the form, one to the left and one to the right of the "Horizontal Line".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301693-b172c380-a776-11eb-86cb-10f56540a199.png)

Now, go to the "Horizontal Line" properties, in the "Presentation" section, in the first list (desktop), select the "Col-lg-12-100%" option. The visual layout will look like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301717-b899d180-a776-11eb-9c8e-c57364ab9365.png)

Now run the application.

You will notice that on the register screen it will be arranged in the same way:

This is what the "Horizontal Line" does, it breaks lines to organize the layout of the components.

The repeater is the component used for data presentation within a page, with it you can reproduce the content of a form in the page environment

Select the component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab will appear on the right side of the screen called "Properties of Field" (If it doesn't appear, just click on the component you just dropped).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301801-d23b1900-a776-11eb-8804-a91c7c2885f6.png)

Note that when you insert the Repeater you cannot save the page until you have selected a Datasource in the properties tab.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301842-dd8e4480-a776-11eb-947a-2b584c4d1a07.png)

We can easily do this using the builder. To add the Datasource that we will use, we must go to the "Source" tab in the component properties and click on the "+" button. In this example our DataSource will contain three fields: Name, Age and Phone.

To display the data on the repeater we use another component, label, and add a Datalink to it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301880-e8e17000-a776-11eb-93ab-12295c0cfeb8.png)

This data link was defined in the Datasource that we created in the previous step. Look in properties for the Datalink tab and select the element you want to display.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116302012-10d0d380-a777-11eb-80b4-27ff612e3271.png)

(Translation: Are you sure you want to delete the tab? Yes, No)

For this tutorial on how to use the 'Tab', we will use two forms.

We will create the first form, name it "Animals", and then add a textfield component and name it "Large Animals".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117339961-bde1d500-ae76-11eb-83c6-17278f81b1f2.png)

Save and run the application.

Now let's create the second form, name it "Extra Animal Info", and add the "Textfield" component and name it "Animal Habitat".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117339995-c76b3d00-ae76-11eb-9dea-9bbd595ae36a.png)

Save and run the application.

Now go back to editing the first form ("Animals").

Now click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117344604-ed471080-ae7b-11eb-85ff-5fbbef0a98df.png). 
The following tab will appear:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117344752-1f587280-ae7c-11eb-8c39-1e758bec3a9f.png)


Under "Class Name" search for "extrainfodoanimal" and select it.

In "Tab Name" type "Tab da Info Extra". In "Relationship" select the option "1:N".

It will show the following content:

to edit the form.

Select the "Extra Info Tab" that is next to "Main".

Now click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117346550-47e16c00-ae7e-11eb-85aa-878bbc5f97d7.png).

You can add more records for the same animal.

And it is also possible to save more fields in the tab for the same animal, just add one more field in the 'Extra Animal Info' form and then add the extra field in the "Aggregation Fields" while editing the tab. Then just save and run the application.

<div id='id-Kanban'/>

## Kanban 🎰
To create a kanban, you need to create a new form, and then the header will appear as follows: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355489-03a79900-ae89-11eb-8310-c882e6007371.png)

Select the option "Kanban":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355507-0a361080-ae89-11eb-97fb-6360484e2868.png)

Fill in the "Form Title" field, and then select the "Project" and "Menu Group".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355514-0f935b00-ae89-11eb-82f6-ea3fa051b143.png)

And then click the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355559-1fab3a80-ae89-11eb-95a7-3ed3a17901b0.png) button at the bottom of the page.

To make it possible for Kanban to pull in the tasks, another form needs to be created to record these tasks.

So now let's create a new form:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355713-4d907f00-ae89-11eb-8ba7-58a3f9b709a2.png)

Fill in the essential information: "Form Title" with "Task" and select the same project and Kanban menu.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355777-5da85e80-ae89-11eb-8539-3e5b57736a37.png)

and then add 3 components into the form: one "Dropdown" and two "Textfields":
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355805-639e3f80-ae89-11eb-9da6-6b330c4fe683.png)

Name the 'Dropdown' "Column Field", the 1st textfield "Label" and the 2nd textfield "Description".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355844-6f8a0180-ae89-11eb-9b5f-aeb0a576e9a7.png)

Click on the "Column Field", in the field properties, in the "Values" section

click on the green add button:  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355886-7e70b400-ae89-11eb-9a6e-8d44744862fe.png)

In the "Enumerations" modal window, set the name to "Status", Type "String". 

click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355963-95afa180-ae89-11eb-86dd-0891fc620005.png)

and add the options "Pending", "Approved", and "Rejected".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356003-a6f8ae00-ae89-11eb-894e-ffe8b6d0e679.png)

Então click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356027-afe97f80-ae89-11eb-8f54-6361f0cbfa9e.png). Run the application.

Now go back to the Kanban screen and refresh the page (hit the F5 key).
In the field properties, on the "Form" dropdown select the form we just created ("Task"). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356142-ce4f7b00-ae89-11eb-93eb-9bc7da56bcf6.png)

And in the 'Column Field', 'Label' and 'Description' dropdowns, select the respective fields that we created for them: "Column Field", "Label" and "Description". (like in the image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356172-d7404c80-ae89-11eb-9246-b7c0a71a3135.png)

Now run the Kanban application.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356213-e0311e00-ae89-11eb-9402-33f064527765.png)

Here you can see the Kanban layout.

Let us continue with the process, click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356329-f939cf00-ae89-11eb-9af5-369a5fa44655.png).

In "Column Field" select the option ''Pending'', in 'Label' write "Hotel Website" and in 'Description' write "1 month deadline".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356387-0b1b7200-ae8a-11eb-8285-1dd12578453b.png)


click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356400-0f478f80-ae8a-11eb-9be9-e0496b074cc5.png).

And now you can move the item "Hotel Website" to the "approved" or "declined" tab (just select it, press and drag it to the other card).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356479-271f1380-ae8a-11eb-982a-b193af472914.png)

And this is the Kanban in action. To add more tasks, just repeat the process:

And here you can edit the class name, column title, column width and create events.

Run this application (with "Name" and "Age"). And then add the following records:

"Joaquim Santos" - "34"
  
"Maria Alice" - "23"
  
"João Carlos" - "21"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117494677-0e2a6700-af4b-11eb-95cb-8c46e2239be6.png)

Now go back to editing the list.

Drop the "Integer" component where it says "Drop new filter here!" and name it "age filter".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117494875-4c278b00-af4b-11eb-835b-babf23c015ce.png)

Notice that next to the "Age Filter" field there is a " = (equal) " symbol, you can change it to other types of symbols.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117495247-c1935b80-af4b-11eb-8aa8-aede23006352.png)
