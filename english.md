## It's time to get hands-on 🖐️

Now we will learn how to make a basic project, menu and form, so you can try out the features of Easy Builder.
    
After logging in to Builder you will find the following content:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114769820-107d1500-9d41-11eb-9ae1-29954922a707.png">

In the "Main" tab and right under "Project title" type in your project's title (can be "ProjectTest") 
    
![ProjectTest13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087176-30cc1d80-c0bc-11eb-99a3-9f1dba3ae763.gif)
   
and click on the "_Save & Close_" button

![Save$closeg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087205-5b1ddb00-c0bc-11eb-93fd-7c4d2d961a28.gif)

(As the database for your project is being created, this step might take a while)

Now you'll be on the "Project" tab in the home page with three other main tabs (which are "Form" and "Report"). 

Then, you will be back at the home screen with the two main tabs "Form" and "Report" (which means "Form" and "Report" respectively), now click on the "Form" tab which is marked in green:

![image](./BuilderImages/form.png)

And now click on the _Form_ button, which is marked in red in the image above, will automatically open a new tab in your browser.
    
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114773410-694eac80-9d45-11eb-9582-bb667046a328.png">
    
On this new page, in the "Form Title" field write the title of your form (it can be "FormTest").    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087290-f57e1e80-c0bc-11eb-96d1-919007483897.png)
    
Click the _"Save"_ button that is on the page bottom right.
    
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114774084-31943480-9d46-11eb-992d-d3c930421db8.png">

Select the "Textfield" component (which is on the left menu - "Tools") and drag it to the gray field where it says "Drop new field here!"

Now click on the component you dragged ("Textfield"), and soon a side tab called "Properties of Field" will open on the right.⤵️
    
![Animação](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120087612-c5844a80-c0bf-11eb-98df-d4e9f601fc26.gif)
    
There at the top of the "Properties of Field", under "General", on the "Name" field write ''Name'' and in the "Label" field also write "Name".
Now click the _"Save"_ button and then click the _"Run"_ button, it will open the following page:
    
![textemaild2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121060294-d7897b80-c798-11eb-8639-350840b5b68f.gif)

The preview of the saved records will be available here. ⤴️

> Click on the _"New"_ button, you'll be directed to the following screen:

![formtestnew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121061502-4a472680-c79a-11eb-9e3c-0eb0807ac8ad.gif)

Add the name "Lopes", and click the _"Save & Close"_ button !!!
    
![formtestnewnamelopes2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121063430-aad76300-c79c-11eb-9304-515445ae9ca9.gif)
    
<h3>⚠️Be careful to not confuse "Save" instead of "Save & Close"</h3>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114779385-702ced80-9d4c-11eb-8838-8133ec0a3aea.png">

Repeat the process putting different names.

You can download the list of records in excel list format by clicking on the _"Export Excel"_ button and then the link to download the excel list will be sent to your email.
    
A short gif to help you:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114777405-09a6d000-9d4a-11eb-8a04-d538d5b34a76.gif">
    
### How to Run the Application 💻
    
When you get to the form screen, fill in the "Form Title"(the title of the form) and insert the "Textfield" and "Email" components:
    
![textemail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/120090145-8c0b0980-c0d6-11eb-9d19-a338ebf9ae7d.gif)

We can now run the application, to do this, click the _"SAVE"_ button at the bottom of the page and then click the _"Run"_ button 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/114936682-20fdc000-9e13-11eb-93dc-1dcc895356fa.gif">
    
You will go to the following screen

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121071158-fb9f8980-c7a5-11eb-8f1f-3017724cdcb9.png)

This is the screen of the inserted and saved records.⤴️

To insert new records, click the _"New"_ button at the top of this screen⬇️
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121071360-373a5380-c7a6-11eb-8657-e45baf0201d6.png)

Then the following screen will open:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121073357-ca748880-c7a8-11eb-9d34-7f61701326fe.png)

This is the register screen, where you will enter the new information within the system.

After filling in the fields, click the _"Save & Close" button.

![formtestnewnamelopesemail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121073189-96996300-c7a8-11eb-8af4-374d46eaa43a.gif)

And you will be back at the records screen, with the form saved and available for viewing. 
*If you want to edit the saved form,click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115065229-41d21e00-9ec4-11eb-85f7-9674e8483492.png"> (Under the "Control" column)

## WARNINGS⚠️

To avoid repetition of content, in most components the "Properties of Field" sections (General, Values, Behavior, Presentation, Intro, Others) wont be shown.

So, to learn how to use these sections mentioned above, go to the "Textfield" component tutorial, because it will explain each section in detail.

However, you will have components showing the sections, because they'll have different items and sections than the "Textfield" component.

To learn how to use the "Events" section, go to the tutorials of the "Decimal" and "Button" components.

Always check if there is continuation of content on the next page, sometimes the image doesn't fit on the same page.

To perform the "Static Image", "Upload Image", and "File Upload" tutorials, you must have storage (Blob Container).

If you have any questions, please contact Easy Comtec support.

<div id='id-component'/>

# COMPONENTS 🧱
There are 30 components that we will learn how to use, they are:
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Textfield</td>
  <td>TextArea</td>
  <td>Editor</td>
  <td>Hidden</td>
  <td>Integer</td>
  <td>Decimal</td>
  <td>Date</th>
  <td>DateTime</td>
  <td>Time</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Checkbox</td>
  <td>ChecklistDB</td>
  <td>Radio</td>
  <td>Dropdown</td>
  <td>DropdownDB</td>
  <td>AutoComplete</td>
  <td>Label</td>
  <td>Box</td>
  <td>Signature</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Static Image</td>
  <td>Upload Image</td>
  <td>File Upload</td>
  <td>One-To-Many</td>
  <td>Multitag</td>
 <td>Additional Data</td>
  <td>Button</td>
  <td>HTML FIeld</td>
  <td>Quizz</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Email</td>
  <td>Password</td>
  <td>Horizontal Line</td>
 </tr>
</table>

It is important to realize that in the "Properties of Field" right menu, there are several sections ("General", "Behavior", "Presentation", "Events", "Intro", etc) but depending on the component it could have more or fewer sections and/ or items.

This is an example from the "Properties of Field" area of the "Textfield" component.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115268685-e5b00980-a110-11eb-9b9e-1215c566626a.png">

It is important to know this so that it makes the process of locating the sections, items, etc easier.

Another recurring situation is referencing the tutorial from one component to another tutorial within this document.

It is also important that you have already performed the steps in the tutorials "How to Create Your First Project, Menu and Form" and "How to Run the Application".

## Textfield 📓

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116603558-6e922680-a903-11eb-8b7f-65c1a9b26f2f.png)

The "Textfield" component is for writing text, mainly names, but it can also be used to record phone numbers using the mask on the field properties, which will be shown how to do it soon.

Select the "Textfield" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab called "Properties of Field" will appear on the right side of the screen

(If it doesn't appear, click on the component you just dropped).

### Textfield 📓 > GENERAL 🎖️

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115269185-6f5fd700-a111-11eb-992d-2e9493159141.png">

In this "Properties of Field" tab, under "General", you have the "Name" field, this refers to the field identification for the coding, for possible programming later. Generally you will repeat what is written in "Label", which is the field identification for the user.

The "Column Title" field is used to identify the field when viewing the list (to view in list format, look at the top of the page and select "List").

The "Placeholder" field serves as a guide for what to fill in, it is interesting that you visualize this, write in the "Testing" field, observe the effect on the field in the form.

![000testing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122480578-7b4a0700-cfa3-11eb-80d1-e8a5aaba10d3.png)

### Textfield 📓 > VALUES 1️⃣

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115285074-d5555a00-a123-11eb-80ae-0092b27958a4.png">

In "Properties of Field", under "Values", there are 4 fields and a checkbox, which are respectively "Mask", "Default", "Minimum Length", "Maximum Length" and "Enable Barcode Scanner".

Under "Mask" you can determine the specific fill pattern, i.e. specific number and type of characters. For example, 
if you want the field to accept phone numbers in a specific format, you can fill this field with (99)99999-9999, do this now for testing.

To make it harmonious, go to "Name" and "Label" and write "Phone Number". Leave the "Placeholder" field blank.

Run the application.

![formtestnumber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121075901-1ffe6480-c7ac-11eb-9c4c-efed9654570d.gif)


Fill in the "Phone number" field with any number, it can be (99)99999-9999
and then click the button ![Save Close](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123150638-fc3c4f00-d438-11eb-9895-674a5dc67a82.png)


You are now able to view your records:
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121239691-f1e25880-c86f-11eb-8288-028d7c89dd6a.png)

 and it is the same process when adding new records.

"Default" refers to an automatic value fill. Enter in the "Default" field of "Phone Number" with "(45)99887-6655".

Run the application.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115288674-1b142180-a128-11eb-82f0-3a930b0e05aa.png">

Note that it is already filled in with (45)99887-6655, but you can change it.

"Minimum Length" refers to the minimum number of characters to be used when filling the field. For example, select and drag one more "Textfield" component into the form and edit just the "Minimum Length" field setting it to a value of 5.

Run the application. When you fill the field you will notice that you need at least 5 characters to be able to save the record

"Maximum Length" refers to the maximum number of characters allowed when filling the field. For example, you can select and drag one more "Textfield" into the form and then edit just this "Maximum Length" setting to a value of 10.

Run the application. When you fill in the field you will notice that a maximum of 10 characters will be allowed in order to be able to save the record.

"Enable Barcode Scanner" refers to enabling barcode scanning. You can test this setting by selecting the check box and then run the application. On the registration screen, 
click on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115289090-9a095a00-a128-11eb-82ee-a03ac0411da2.png"> and then it will trigger the device's camera, and scan the barcode.

### Textfield 📓 > BEHAVIOR 🎬

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115289428-ed7ba800-a128-11eb-89a1-a0fd60d1efef.png">

Here you will find 3 checkboxes (Required, Disabled and Visible) and 3 drop-down lists (Visibility Rules, Required Rules and Disabled Rules).

Translation: 

Required = Required
Disabled = Disabled
Visible

Visibility Rules 
Required Rules = Required Rules 
Disabled Rules

By default, the checkboxes "Required" and "Visible" will be checked, and the "Disabled" box will be unchecked.

You can change from required to optional, visible to invisible, and disabled to enabled by checking or unchecking the checkbox.

Regarding the rules for visibility, mandatory and disabled, it is important to note that they are dependent on another field within the form.

Let's test this in practice. Select and drag the "Integer" component into the form.

![2 1](./BuilderImages/intege.gif)

 in the "Properties of Field", under "General", under "Name" and "Label" fill the field with "Age". 

![4 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121244680-8b603900-c875-11eb-8355-85aca08299c5.gif)

Go back to edit the properties of the "Phone Number" under "Behavior" ,click on the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116604024-00019880-a904-11eb-9089-83baafbf8fa3.png) of the "Visibility Rules" ⤵️

![5 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121245012-e8f48580-c875-11eb-8ec4-a5db31048de3.gif)

will open the following window:<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115290616-223c2f00-a12a-11eb-902f-4ff56b703292.png">

in "Name" write "Age Rule", in "Type" select "Integer", in "Operation" select "Greater or Equal", in "Value" write "18".⤵️

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121246873-fca0eb80-c877-11eb-8738-726df64130c7.gif)

Now click on the button ![Save](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123150789-22fa8580-d439-11eb-81a7-83fdbd8d3bc3.png) and deselect the "Visible" checkbox.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115290773-50217380-a12a-11eb-805e-a2f0cde5d796.png)

Then click on the "Visibility Rules" drop-down list (from the "Age" field) and select "Age Rule":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121247013-20fcc800-c878-11eb-9b72-00ab4a7722cf.png)

 and then another list will appear below, click and select "Age".
(image on the next page)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121248260-a03ecb80-c879-11eb-8dae-0318adc16220.png)

Now run the application.

Automatically a new page will open in your browser (records screen), click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115290892-7810d700-a12a-11eb-8693-bb6fb8a2f6a0.png)

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121250169-c9605b80-c87b-11eb-8f29-9c06afae1cb4.gif)

Fill the field "Age" with "18" and notice that the field "Telephone Number" appears to be filled in.

and if you fill in the field "Age" with "17", the field "Phone Number" won't appear.

You can apply these rules in the same way for mandatory and deactivation.

### Textfield 📓 > OTHERS 📝
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115293506-cb385900-a12d-11eb-95ab-031c63694490.png)

Here in the "Others" section you will find this "Feed Data" list, which is used to fill the field with dummy data to validate it.

With the field "Phone Number" or "Full Name" you can fill it with the option "Phone" or "People" respectively.

Now run the application.

Automatically a new page will open in your browser, and you will see the registration of dummy phone numbers/names on the screen (next page), which will check the field as valid.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115293603-ec00ae80-a12d-11eb-9cd5-6b381b83ff9c.png)


### Textfield 📓 > PRESENTATION 📊

In this section you can edit how much space the field will occupy on the screens of desktops, tablets, horizontal mobiles and vertical mobiles respectively. The space occupied can vary from 8% to 100%.

Click on the "Number" field created earlier.⬇️

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121411393-f410e980-c939-11eb-8e55-983583d46e24.png)

If you are using desktop, click on the first drop-down list and then choose the "col-lg-12:100%" option and observe how it looks on the form.

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121412846-7f3eaf00-c93b-11eb-8f7f-f9ed34fa502a.gif)

Run the application.

You can go back to the form editing screen and test with the other measurements to see how they look.

To learn more about how to use this feature, go to the "Events" section of the "Decimal" and "Button" components.

### Textfield 📓 > INTRO ℹ️ 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294185-a7c1de00-a12e-11eb-9481-9df98b38dfef.png)

The "Intro" section serves as an instructive introduction, to explain about filling out the fields or whatever you think is important.

It is important to know that this functionality will only work the first time, if you want to test it again you will need to create a new form.

Let's test this now, select and drop two "Textfield" components into the form. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294159-9d9fdf80-a12e-11eb-8c99-378be69a4962.png)

On the first "Textfield", under "Position" select "Top", under "Order" type "1", under "Message" write "This is the first" (image on the next page).

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121413506-202d6a00-c93c-11eb-94b7-dd5ff872cc6c.png)

In the second "Textfield", in "Position" select "Right", in "Order" type "2", in "Message" write "This is the second one" .

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121413692-54a12600-c93c-11eb-8624-ae422147da0c.png)

Now run the application, and the following page will open:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121414734-5e775900-c93d-11eb-9796-59e6901722a0.png)

click on this button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/115294470-05562a80-a12f-11eb-9dd2-e6adb2664492.png).

Then the intro effect will appear on the following page:
![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/121414658-430c4e00-c93d-11eb-8a95-04c267751222.png)

This visualization of the highlighted field with the message beside (or below, etc.), is the effect of the settings in the "Intro" section.

You can keep adding new fields and switching the order and messages, but remember that it only works the first time, so to test it again you need to create a new form.

<div id='id-textarea'/>

Notice that it is already filled in with "10", but you can change it.

Minimum Value: refers to the minimum value of the number to be used when filling the field. To test it, fill this field with "5".

Run the application.

Fill the field with "4" and then with "5" and notice that the minimum value to be entered is "5" to be able to save the information entered in the field.

Maximum Value: refers to the maximum value of the number to be used when filling out the field. To test it, fill this field with "15".

Run the application. 

Fill the field with "15" and then with "16" and notice that the maximum value allowed is "15" to be able to save the information entered in the field.

Auto Increment: Will start with the value 1 and then continue with the sequence (2,3,4...) automatically. If you have an initial value defined, for example "34", it will continue from there (35,36,37...), like in the following example images:

## Gantt 📊📅

![image](./BuilderImages/iconeGantt.png)

With the "Gantt" component, it is possible to track the progress of tasks over time.

⚠️ For the functionality of this component, it will be necessary to create two additional forms: Projects and Tasks.

In the "Projects" form, record the names of the projects in a Textfield.

![image](./BuilderImages/telatodaGanttinglês.png)

In the "Tasks" form, record the following information:

- Project (DropdownDB);
- Task (Textfield);
- Main task (DropdownDB);
- Start date planned (Date);
- End date planned (Date);
- Start date (Date);
- End date (Date);
- Task progress (Integer).

![image](./BuilderImages/tasksGantt.png)

💡The Project DropdownDB should reference the Textfield from the "Projects" form.

💡The Main task DropdownDB should reference the Task field in the "Tasks" form.

🚨The labels of the components may vary, but ALL of them are ESSENTIAL for the proper functioning of the "Gantt" component.

Here is an example of records for Projects and Tasks, respectively.

![image](./BuilderImages/datagridprojectsGantt.png)

So, let's start by creating one more form (as shown in the tutorial "How to Create Your First Project, Menu and Form").

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/magnoeasy/easybuilder/blob/main/english.md#id-frist">How to Create Your First Project, Menu and Form</a></li>

To make the "Signature" component work you will need one more "DateTime" or "Date" component and two "Hidden" components.

So first we will add the "DateTime" component and name it "Date and Time", and name the "Signature" component as "Signature".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116140745-23330a80-a6ae-11eb-96ae-78a7e38011a2.png)


Select the checkbox "Current DateTime" from the "Values" section of the "DateTime" component to always be getting the current date and time.

Now select and drop the 2 "Hidden" components on top of the "Signature" and the "DateTime" components

Use the `public` property when:
- Your image is not sensitive data and sharing it won't expose private information
- You want to optimize performance, since your image can be loaded faster due lack of extra process to verify the permissions
- You are working on a public page(like a landing page) which should not require your users to log in

When you mark an upload image as `public` it'll no longer get verified by you configured permissions
- It will be accessable by users even if they don't have not been granted with permissions to view the form where the image was saved
- It will be accessable even by users that are not logged in
- It will be stored on a public repository

### MultiTag 🏷️ > SOURCE 🔌

![image](./BuilderImages/Sourcemulttag.png)

To make use of the "MultiTag" component we will have to create 3 forms. The first to add the names, the second to connect the names to a "DropdownDB" component, and then connect the second to the third form that will be the "MultiTag" form.

First step, create a new form with the "Textfield" component, also naming it "Team Member". 
![TeamMember](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122629734-9432e500-d095-11eb-941e-bed31ce41b26.png)

Run the application, on the "Run screen" click on "New" and add the names "John", "Mary", "Charles" and "Luke" (for each name you'll have to save, save & close and then repeat the process of adding the name)

<img src="./BuilderImages/Changes/teammember.jpg">

Second step, create one more form using the "DropdownDB" component and name it "team meeting".
![TeamMeeting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122629793-04da0180-d096-11eb-9273-2578bb40404f.png)

Beside it, this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116296065-27276100-a770-11eb-87e6-82d451cce125.png) is for updating the list, and the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116296149-3f977b80-a770-11eb-8771-9dfb8c91937a.png) is for adding a DataSource. 

To learn more about creating a DataSource, scroll down to the "DataSource" tutorial.

It is important to know that the DataSource is the name given to the connection to a database from the server. That is, you need to create this database, which can be the records created inside another form.

Therefore, it is also important that you have created the other form within the same project, and that you have the field added to "pull" from the database. 

DataSource Filter: will perform a filter inside the selected DataSource, i.e., if the DataSource has 10 fields, you can select if you want all of them or just one of them. 

Source Field: will pull the information from the source field.

Show: The options are: "First", "Last", and "Max" which means "First", "Last", and "Max" respectively.
 
Sorted by: Will sort the DataSource by the chosen option.

We will test this by creating two forms. On the first one we will name it "Source", on this one we will use two components: "Textfield" and "Dropdown".

Drag the "Textfield" component into the form and name it "Name", do the same with the "Dropdown" component and name it "Status". 

![Origin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/122852967-d8b5bf00-d2e7-11eb-8f77-dc2333c0c2e6.png)

(To learn more about the "Dropdown" component, go to its tutorial)

"Horizontal Line" does line breaks, with the main purpose of organizing the arrangement of components.

Select the "Horizontal Line" component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! 
![image](./BuilderImages/HorizontalLinegif.gif)

When you place the "Horizontal Line" inside the form, you will notice that it is just a line, with the only function of organizing the arrangement of the components inside the screen.

Let's add two "Textfield" components inside the form, one to the left and one to the right of the "Horizontal Line".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301693-b172c380-a776-11eb-86cb-10f56540a199.png)

Now, go to the "Horizontal Line" properties (you can do that by clicking on the dragged component), in the "Presentation" section, on the first list (desktop), select the "Col-lg-12-100%" option. The visual layout will look like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301717-b899d180-a776-11eb-9c8e-c57364ab9365.png)

<div id='id-Repeater'/>

## Repeater 🔁
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301777-c9e2de00-a776-11eb-8741-38544753cb5d.png)

The repeater is the component used for data presentation within a page, with it you can reproduce the content of a form in the page environment

Select the component, then drag and drop it where it says "Drop new field here! When you drop it, a tab called "Properties of Field" will appear on the right side of the screen (If it doesn't, just click on the component you just dropped).
![image](./BuilderImages/RepeaterGif.gif)

Note that when you insert the Repeater you cannot save the page until you have selected a Datasource in the properties tab.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301842-dd8e4480-a776-11eb-947a-2b584c4d1a07.png)

We can easily do this using builder. To add the Datasource that we will use, we must go to the "Source" tab in the component properties and click on the "+" button. In this example our DataSource will contain three fields: Name, Age and Phone.

To display the data on the repeater we use another component, label, and add a Databind to it
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116301880-e8e17000-a776-11eb-93ab-12295c0cfeb8.png)

This data link was defined in the Datasource that we created in the previous step. Look in properties for the Databind tab and select the element you want to display.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/116302012-10d0d380-a777-11eb-80b4-27ff612e3271.png)

Notice that the fields are automatically displayed as defined in the Datasource

🔸Color (component's border)

🔹Padding: the distance between a component's content and its borders (in pixels)

🔹Margin: the distance between components (in pixels)

![image](./BuilderImages/section3.png)

➡️ Add these measurements in different dimensions of the component.

- Top
- Right
- Bottom
- Left

➡️ Activate the "Display Flex" option to transform the component into a flexible container and align "child" items.

![image](./BuilderImages/displayflexCSS.png)

📌 Flex-Direction: alignment direction.

![image](./BuilderImages/flexdirectionCSS.png)

📌 Justify-Content: horizontal alignment of items.
- center
- flex-start (beginning border)
- flex-end (final border)
- space around (equal space between items, with equal spacing for margins)
- space-between (equal space between items, close to the margin)

![image](./BuilderImages/justifycontentCSS.png)

📌 Flex-Wrap: defines whether items should break the line or not.
- wrap (breaks the line as soon as one of the flex items can no longer be compressed)
- nowrap (default value, does not allow line break)
- wrap-reverse (breaks the line as soon as one of the flex items can no longer be compressed. The break is in the opposite direction, meaning to the above line)

![image](./BuilderImages/flexwrapCSS.png)

📌 Align-Items: vertical alignment of items.
- center
- flex-start (beginning border)
- flex-end (final border)
- stretch (stretches the items to fill the entire container)
- baseline (items are aligned according to the alignment of their texts)

![image](./BuilderImages/alignitemsCSS.png)

📌 Align-Content: organizes the rows of the container when there is extra space on the vertical axis.
- space-between (items evenly distributed; the first row at the beginning of the container, and the last row at the end of the container)
- space-around (items evenly distributed with the same spacing between each row)
- stretch (items in each row stretch to fill the remaining space between them)
- center
- flex-start
- flex-end

![image](./BuilderImages/aligncontentCSS.png)

🔹Font-Family

🔹Text align

![image](./BuilderImages/section4.png)

🔹Size (label): px, %, vh, vw, rem, em

## Kanban 🎰
To create a kanban, you need to create a new form, and then the header will appear as it follows: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355489-03a79900-ae89-11eb-8310-c882e6007371.png)

Select the option "Kanban":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355507-0a361080-ae89-11eb-97fb-6360484e2868.png)

Fill in the "Form Title" field, and then select the "Project" and "Menu Group".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355514-0f935b00-ae89-11eb-82f6-ea3fa051b143.png)

And then click the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355559-1fab3a80-ae89-11eb-95a7-3ed3a17901b0.png) button at the bottom of the page.

To make it possible for Kanban to pull in the tasks, another form needs to be created to record these tasks.

So now let's create a new form:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355713-4d907f00-ae89-11eb-8ba7-58a3f9b709a2.png)

Fill in the essential information: "Form Title" with "Task" and select the same project and Kanban menu.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355777-5da85e80-ae89-11eb-8539-3e5b57736a37.png)

then add 3 components into the form: one "Dropdown" and two "Textfields":
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355805-639e3f80-ae89-11eb-9da6-6b330c4fe683.png)

Name the 'Dropdown' "Column Field", the 1st textfield "Label" and the 2nd textfield "Description".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355844-6f8a0180-ae89-11eb-9b5f-aeb0a576e9a7.png)

Click on the "Column Field", in the field properties, in the "Values" section

click on the green add button:  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355886-7e70b400-ae89-11eb-9a6e-8d44744862fe.png)

In the "Enumerations" modal window, set the name to "Status", and the type to "String". 

Click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117355963-95afa180-ae89-11eb-86dd-0891fc620005.png) and add the options "Pending", "Approved", and "Rejected".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356003-a6f8ae00-ae89-11eb-894e-ffe8b6d0e679.png)

Then click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356027-afe97f80-ae89-11eb-8f54-6361f0cbfa9e.png) and run the application.

Now go back to the Kanban screen and refresh the page (hit the F5 key).
In the field properties, on the "Form" dropdown select the form we just created ("Task"). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356142-ce4f7b00-ae89-11eb-93eb-9bc7da56bcf6.png)

And in the 'Column Field', 'Label' and 'Description' dropdowns, select the respective fields that we created for them: "Column Field", "Label" and "Description". (like in the image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356172-d7404c80-ae89-11eb-9246-b7c0a71a3135.png)

Now run the Kanban application.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356213-e0311e00-ae89-11eb-9402-33f064527765.png)

Here you can see the Kanban layout.

Let us continue with the process, click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356329-f939cf00-ae89-11eb-9af5-369a5fa44655.png).

In "Column Field" select the option ''Pending'', in 'Label' write "Hotel Website" and in 'Description' write "1 month deadline".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356387-0b1b7200-ae8a-11eb-8285-1dd12578453b.png)

Click on the button ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356400-0f478f80-ae8a-11eb-9be9-e0496b074cc5.png).

And now you can move the item "Hotel Website" to the "approved" or "declined" tab (just select it, press and drag it to the other column).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356479-271f1380-ae8a-11eb-982a-b193af472914.png)

And this is the Kanban in action. To add more tasks, just repeat the process:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117356511-30a87b80-ae8a-11eb-8bf8-33d94e12b295.png)

And here you can edit the class name, column title, column width and create events.

Run this application (with "Name" and "Age"). And then add the following records:

"Joaquim Santos" - "34"
  
"Maria Alice" - "23"
  
"João Carlos" - "21"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117494677-0e2a6700-af4b-11eb-95cb-8c46e2239be6.png)

Now go back to editing the list.

Drop the "Integer" component where it says "Drop new filter here!" and name it "age filter".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117494875-4c278b00-af4b-11eb-835b-babf23c015ce.png)

And in the "Age Filter" properties, in the "Others" section, under "Filtered Field" select the "Age" option.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117494896-56e22000-af4b-11eb-98d1-c82499a2c4b2.png)

Notice that next to the "Age Filter" field there is a " = " (equal) symbol, you can change it to other types of symbols.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117495247-c1935b80-af4b-11eb-8aa8-aede23006352.png)

For example, this highlighted symbol means "Equal or greater", select this one.

Now type in the filter field the number "22" and then click the ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117495272-cb1cc380-af4b-11eb-80a4-1cfbb943095c.png) button.

And notice that now "Joao Carlos", who is "21", is no longer shown.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117495313-d66fef00-af4b-11eb-9776-d1327976c8f6.png)

And now you can see the users that are inserted in the "Role".


<div id="id-Form-Events" />

## Form Events ⚡

<p>Forms events run scripts on specific events that happen while using forms.</p>

####Events Types:
<ul>
<li><b>OnLoadForm</b>  - Called whenever a Page is loaded.</li>
<li><b>OnNewForm</b> - Called whenever the user clicks to insert new records</li>
<li><b>OnEditForm</b> - Called whenever you edit a record</li>
</ul>

####Examples of use:
To use it just declare a function in the "Custom scripts" with the name of the event, in this case the "onNewForm" was used.

<img src="./BuilderImages/FormEvents/OnNewFormDesign.gif">

At runtime, the constructor will look for the function with the keyword "onNewForm" in your "Custom Scripts" and execute it if it exists

<img src="./BuilderImages/FormEvents/OnNewFormRuntime.gif">

With "OnLoadForm" and "OnEditForm" the usage is the same.

Edit Form:
<img src="./BuilderImages/FormEvents/OnEditForm.gif">

Page:
<img src="./BuilderImages/FormEvents/OnLoadForm.gif">

Note: "OnLoadForm" is only effective in Pages.

<div id='id-Tools'/>

## Tools 🔧 

### 🔧 X form

The creation of this form will serve to perform the tutorials of the "Tools" sections:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117498835-b5f66380-af50-11eb-9015-d259556c6480.png)


This way it will be easier to proceed with the next steps of learning.

So, create your new form, name it "Form X" and select a previously created "Project" and "Menu" to the test.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117498862-bf7fcb80-af50-11eb-82a6-aa9210888d5a.png)


Drag a "Textfield" component and a "Dropdown" into the form:

Rename the "Textfield" to "Full Name" and the "Dropdown" to "Function", in both "Name" and "Label" in the "General" section of the "Properties of Field".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117498919-d4f4f580-af50-11eb-8be6-3433989b24cc.png)

On the "Values" section of the "Role" field, add the options "Programmer", "Support" and "Designer":

![Enumeration function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/123556476-d7f6b000-d761-11eb-8275-910d5c4b383b.png)

Run the application:.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117498964-e6d69880-af50-11eb-99b0-8aa2ad98e4b1.png)

Now add the following set of names and functions:
<ol>
 <li>Mark / Programmer</li>
 <li>Lucas / Programmer</li>
 <li>Paulo / Support</li>
 <li>Bruna / Support</li>
 <li>John / Designer</li>
 <li>Carla / Designer</li>
</ol>

After saving this set, it will be arranged like this on the records screen:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401104/117499097-1dacae80-af51-11eb-877c-8564f794eb49.png)

### Create a grid on a page
####⚠️ Important:
  - For this procedure it will be necessary to use a session’s variable.
  - Remember to Save after each change.

After creating the form with all the data inputs you need, create its data source and add the fields you will need to list on your page:
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0001.png">
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0002.png">

2 pages should be created, one for listing data and the other for editing and deleting data.

Page 1 - Listing data:
Create the page and in page class add the form’s class previously created.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0001.gif">

Step 01 - Building the grid:
Using Label we will make the header of our grid.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0002.gif">

To list the data we’ll use the repeater tool, in its property > Source > DataSource will be picked and the Datasource created.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0003.png">

With the Label tool the Databind with the data source's data “Datasource for grid” will be done
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0003.gif">

⚠️ The step will be repeated for the other entries with their respective Databinds.

Add another label and add on your Databind the form Id and uncheck the visible option.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0004.gif">

Page 02 - Edit the data:
Create the page in Page Class, then add the form’s class in the same way done on the page before.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0004.png">

Add a Hidden and in the properties General > Session Value select the sessions variable created.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0005.gif">

Add a repeater in your properties Source > DataSource and Source >Show, respectively select “Datasource for grid” and “First of Defalt”. (The “First of Default” will show the data to be edit, in case it doesn’t exist, will be automatically created).
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0005.png">

Add the fields that will receive the to-be edited data or will create new ones. The fields should match with the fields created at the beginning of this tutorial.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0006.png">

The added fields should also contain the respective Databinds in addition to Page Class and Class Property in properties > Others.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0006.gif">

Add a Hidden to receive the form’s Databind.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0007.gif">

Add a button and set it up to be responsible for saving the information.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0008.gif">

Back to Page 1 we will add the buttons for editing and deleting the fields.
It will be needed a small script that will pass the Id to the Variable of the session and redirect to page 2, where the data can be edited or created.

Add the button and set it up as shown below (Edit Button):
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0009.gif">

Under "Custom Scripts" copy and paste this script: 

           function redirect() {
    this.session.session_variable = this.entity.Id
    window.open("URL of the form you want to redirect to", "_self");
    }

<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0007.png">

Add the second button and set it up as shown below (Delete Button):
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0010.gif">

⚠️ As this button will only delete one registry entry it won't be necessary a script for it.

To the clicked field on our page 1 can be edited, it will be necessary to set up a filter on the repeater of Page 2.
Click on Repeater of Page 2 and in Properties > Source > Filter and add a new filter, setting it up as done below:
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0011.gif">

Still on Page 2 add a button to go back to Page 1 where all the data is listed.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0012.gif">

Finally, on Page 1 we will add a button to create a new entry.
<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/gifs/0013.gif">

On the Dev Properties tab add the added function to the button.
Script:

           function addNew() {
    this.session.session_variable = null
    window.open("URL of the form you want to redirect to", "_self");
    }


<img src="./BuilderImages/GridInPage/img/0009.png">

⚠️ It is really important that the buttons are in the repeaters so it can work properly.
